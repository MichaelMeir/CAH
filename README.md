## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Clone the repository and make sure to run a single `npm install` in the `client` and `server` directory.
2. Make sure to run the following command in the `server` directory: `cp env.example .env` and fill in your database credentials.
3. To generate the required certificates and keys, please run the provided script. `./generateKey.sh`, in the `server` directory.
4. The final step before the application , you must run `npm run dev` in both `server` and `client` directory. In case you are on a Windows device, we have setup a temporarily `server` script that you have to run instead: `npm run windev`.
